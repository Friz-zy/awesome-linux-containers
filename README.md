## Foundations

* [OPEN CONTAINER INITIATIVE](https://www.opencontainers.org/)  
The Open Container Initiative is a lightweight, open governance structure, to be formed under the auspices of the Linux Foundation, for the express purpose of creating open industry standards around container formats and runtime.
* [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/)  
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation will create and drive the adoption of a new set of common container technologies informed by technical merit and end user value, and inspired by Internet-scale computing.
* [Cloud Foundry Foundation](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/foundation/)  
The Cloud is our foundry.

## Specifications

* [Open Container Specifications](https://github.com/opencontainers/specs)  
This project is where the Open Container Initiative Specifications are written. This is a work in progress. 
* [App Container basics](https://github.com/coreos/rkt/blob/master/Documentation/app-container.md)  
App Container (appc) is an open specification that defines several aspects of how to run applications in containers: an image format, runtime environment, and discovery protocol.

## Clouds

* [Developer Cloud Platform](https://www.dotcloud.com/)  
PaaS from Docker creators.
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/)

## Hypervisors

* [Docker](https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker#cloud-infrastructure)  
An open platform for distributed applications for developers and sysadmins. **Standart de facto**.

Daemon based on liblxc offering a REST API to manage LXC containers.

## Containers

* [OpenVZ](https://openvz.org/Main_Page)  
OpenVZ is container-based virtualization for Linux. OpenVZ creates multiple secure, isolated Linux containers (otherwise known as VEs or VPSs) on a single physical server enabling better server utilization and ensuring that applications do not conflict.

Docker implemented in around 100 lines of bash.
* [Rocket](https://github.com/coreos/rkt)  
rkt (pronounced "rock-it") is a CLI for running app containers on Linux. rkt is designed to be composable, secure, and fast. Based on AppC specification.
* [LXC](https://github.com/lxc/lxc)  
LXC is the well known set of tools, templates, library and language bindings. It's pretty low level, very flexible and covers just about every containment feature supported by the upstream kernel.
* [Vagga](https://github.com/tailhook/vagga)  
Vagga is a fully-userspace container engine inspired by Vagrant and Docker, specialized for development environments.
* [libct](https://github.com/xemul/libct)  
Libct is a containers management library which provides convenient API for frontend programs to rule a container during its whole lifetime.
* [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/drvlxc.html)  
A big toolkit to interact with the virtualization capabilities of recent versions of Linux (and other OSes).

## Sandboxes

* [Firejail](https://l3net.wordpress.com/projects/firejail/)  
Firejail is a SUID sandbox program that reduces the risk of security breaches by restricting the running environment of untrusted applications using Linux namespaces, seccomp-bpf and Linux capabilities.
* [NsJail](https://github.com/google/nsjail)  
NsJail is a process isolation tool for Linux. It makes use of the the namespacing, resource control, and seccomp-bpf syscall filter subsystems of the Linux kernel.

Securing the Linux desktop with Docker.
* [Snappy](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Specifications/SnappyConfinement)

### Levels of security problems

1) regular application

* always untrusted -> know it
* suid bit -> mount with nosuid
* limit available syscall -> seccomp-bpf, grsec
* leak to another container (bug in namespaces, filesystem) -> user namespaces with different uid inside for each cotainer: 1000 in container - 14293 and 15398 outside; security modules like selinux or apparmor

2) system services like cron, ssh

* run as root -> isolate via bastion host or vm
* using /dev -> "devices" control group  
The following device nodes are created in the container by default.  
The Docker images are also mounted with nodev, which means that even if a device node was pre-created in the image, it could not be used by processes within the container to talk to the kernel.  
/dev/console,/dev/null,/dev/zero,/dev/full,/dev/tty*,/dev/urandom,/dev/random,/dev/fuse
* root calls -> capabilities (cap_sys_admin warning!)  
Here is the current list of capabilities that Docker uses: chown, dac_override, fowner, kill, setgid, setuid, setpcap, net_bind_service, net_raw, sys_chroot, mknod, setfcap, and audit_write.  
Docker removes several of these capabilities including the following:  
CAP_SETPCAP 	Modify process capabilities  
CAP_SYS_MODULE 	Insert/Remove kernel modules   
CAP_SYS_RAWIO 	Modify Kernel Memory  
CAP_SYS_PACCT 	Configure process accounting  
CAP_SYS_NICE 	Modify Priority of processes  
CAP_SYS_RESOURCE 	Override Resource Limits  
CAP_SYS_TIME 	Modify the system clock  
CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG 	Configure tty devices  
CAP_AUDIT_WRITE 	Write the audit log  
CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL 	Configure Audit Subsystem  
CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE 	Ignore Kernel MAC Policy  
CAP_MAC_ADMIN 	Configure MAC Configuration  
CAP_SYSLOG 	Modify Kernel printk behavior  
CAP_NET_ADMIN 	Configure the network  
CAP_SYS_ADMIN 	Catch all  
uses /proc, /sys -> remount ro, drop cap_sys_admin; security modules like selinux or apparmor; some part of this fs are "namespace-aware"  
Docker mounts these file systems into the container as "read-only" mount points.  
. /sys  
. /proc/sys  
. /proc/sysrq-trigger  
. /proc/irq  
. /proc/bus  
Copy-on-write file systems  
Docker uses copy-on-write file systems. This means containers can use the same file system image as the base for the container. When a container writes content to the image, it gets written to a container specific file system. This prevents one container from seeing the changes of another container even if they wrote to the same file system image. Just as important, one container can not change the image content to effect the processes in another container.
* uid 0 -> user namespaces, uid 0 mappet to random uid outside

3) system services like devices, network, filesystems

* root -> more of services should work on host outside; isolate sensitive functions, run as non-privilaged context
* full privilages -> isolate on kernel level

4) kernel drivers, network stack, security policies

* absolute privilages -> run it in separate vm

5) general like immutable infrastructure

* container is ro
* write to small separate rw nosuid part

### Technologies for security

Things are better. For example, most modern container technologies can make use of Linux's built-in security tools such as:  
[AppArmor](http://wiki.apparmor.net/index.php/Main_Page), [SELinux](http://selinuxproject.org/page/Main_Page) and [Seccomp](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html) policies;  
[Grsecurity](https://grsecurity.net/);  
[Control groups (cgroups)](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Resource_Management_Guide/ch01.html);  
[Kernel namespaces](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html)  
[src](http://www.itworld.com/article/2920349/security/for-containers-security-is-problem-1.html)

Sure, you're deploying seccomp, but you can't use selinux inside your container, because the policy isn't per-namespace (?? lxc uses apparmore for each container...)  
[sVirt](http://selinuxproject.org/page/SVirt) - selinux for kvm  
[src](https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/33170.html)

Major kernel subsystems are not namespaced like:  
- SELinux  
- Cgroups  
- file systems under /sys  
- /proc/sys, /proc/sysrq-trigger, /proc/irq, /proc/bus

Devices are not namespaced:  
- /dev/mem  
- /dev/sd* file system devices  
- kernel modules

If you can communicate or attack one of these as a privileged process, you can own the system.
