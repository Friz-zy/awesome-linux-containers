## About the Author

Hello, everyone! My name is Filipp, and I have been working with high load distribution systems and services, security, monitoring, continuous deployment and release management (DevOps domain) since 2012.

One of my passions is developing DevOps solutions and contributing to the open-source community. By sharing my knowledge and experiences, I strive to save time for both myself and others while fostering a culture of collaboration and learning.

I had to leave my home country, Belarus, due to my participation in [protests against the oppressive regime of dictator Lukashenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_Belarusian_protests), who maintains a close affiliation with Putin. Since then, I'm trying to build my life from zero in other countries.

If you are seeking a skilled DevOps lead or architect to enhance your project, I invite you to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/filipp-frizzy-289a0360/) or explore my valuable contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/Friz-zy/). Let's collaborate and create some cool solutions together :)

### Levels of security problems

1) regular application

* always untrusted -> know it
* suid bit -> mount with nosuid
* limit available syscall -> seccomp-bpf, grsec
* leak to another container (bug in namespaces, filesystem) -> user namespaces with different uid inside for each container: 1000 in container - 14293 and 15398 outside; security modules like selinux or apparmor

2) system services like cron, ssh

* run as root -> isolate via bastion host or vm
* using /dev -> "devices" control group  
The following device nodes are created in the container by default.  
The Docker images are also mounted with nodev, which means that even if a device node was pre-created in the image, it could not be used by processes within the container to talk to the kernel.  
/dev/console,/dev/null,/dev/zero,/dev/full,/dev/tty*,/dev/urandom,/dev/random,/dev/fuse
* root calls -> capabilities (cap_sys_admin warning!)  
Here is the current list of capabilities that Docker uses: chown, dac_override, fowner, kill, setgid, setuid, setpcap, net_bind_service, net_raw, sys_chroot, mknod, setfcap, and audit_write.  
Docker removes several of these capabilities including the following:  
CAP_SETPCAP 	Modify process capabilities  
CAP_SYS_MODULE 	Insert/Remove kernel modules   
CAP_SYS_RAWIO 	Modify Kernel Memory  
CAP_SYS_PACCT 	Configure process accounting  
CAP_SYS_NICE 	Modify Priority of processes  
CAP_SYS_RESOURCE 	Override Resource Limits  
CAP_SYS_TIME 	Modify the system clock  
CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG 	Configure tty devices  
CAP_AUDIT_WRITE 	Write the audit log  
CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL 	Configure Audit Subsystem  
CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE 	Ignore Kernel MAC Policy  
CAP_MAC_ADMIN 	Configure MAC Configuration  
CAP_SYSLOG 	Modify Kernel printk behavior  
CAP_NET_ADMIN 	Configure the network  
CAP_SYS_ADMIN 	Catch all  
uses /proc, /sys -> remount ro, drop cap_sys_admin; security modules like selinux or apparmor; some part of this fs are "namespace-aware"  
Docker mounts these file systems into the container as "read-only" mount points.  
. /sys  
. /proc/sys  
. /proc/sysrq-trigger  
. /proc/irq  
. /proc/bus  
Copy-on-write file systems  
Docker uses copy-on-write file systems. This means containers can use the same file system image as the base for the container. When a container writes content to the image, it gets written to a container specific file system. This prevents one container from seeing the changes of another container even if they wrote to the same file system image. Just as important, one container can not change the image content to effect the processes in another container.
* uid 0 -> user namespaces, uid 0 mappet to random uid outside

3) system services like devices, network, filesystems

* root -> more of services should work on host outside; isolate sensitive functions, run as non-privileged context
* full privileges -> isolate on kernel level

4) kernel drivers, network stack, security policies

* absolute privileges -> run it in separate vm

5) general like immutable infrastructure

* container is ro
* write to small separate rw nosuid part

### Technologies for security

Things are better. For example, most modern container technologies can make use of Linux's built-in security tools such as:  
[AppArmor](http://wiki.apparmor.net/index.php/Main_Page), [SELinux](http://selinuxproject.org/page/Main_Page) and [Seccomp](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html) policies;  
[Grsecurity](https://grsecurity.net/);  
[Control groups (cgroups)](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Resource_Management_Guide/ch01.html);  
[Kernel namespaces](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html)  
[src](http://www.itworld.com/article/2920349/security/for-containers-security-is-problem-1.html)

Sure, you're deploying seccomp, but you can't use selinux inside your container, because the policy isn't per-namespace (?? lxc uses apparmore for each container...)  
[sVirt](http://selinuxproject.org/page/SVirt) - selinux for kvm  
[src](https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/33170.html)

Major kernel subsystems are not namespaced like:  
- SELinux  
- Cgroups  
- file systems under /sys  
- /proc/sys, /proc/sysrq-trigger, /proc/irq, /proc/bus

Devices are not namespaced:
